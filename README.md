# Earth-Moon-Low-Thrust-Trajectory-Optimization
In this project, I extended the classic three-stage method for computing optimal low-thrust trajectories from low Earth orbit (LEO) to low lunar orbit (LLO) originally proposed by Pierson and Kluever (1994). The original three-stage method systematically decomposes the complex optimal trajectory problem into simpler subproblems involving maximum-energy Earth-escape and moon-capture spirals, an all-coasting translunar trajectory, and finally, a complete optimization using a hybrid direct/indirect numerical method. Unlike the original formulation, which assumes a constant thrust magnitude, my work allowed thrust magnitude to be a free variable within the optimal control framework. Starting from the necessary conditions for optimality, I derived the modified equations and solved them numerically to obtain optimal trajectories. The classical restricted three-body problem dynamics govern the spacecraft trajectory, involving highly sensitive numerical computations and optimization strategies. Our extended methodology enables a more flexible and general approach to modeling low-thrust Earthâ€“Moon transfers. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach, yielding energy-efficient transfer trajectories that improve upon the constant-thrust assumption.
